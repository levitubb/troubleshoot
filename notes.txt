This, unfortunately, didn’t work for me. Instead I did the following:
[[[How to create a Streamlit desktop app]]]

Create the following package.json file to start a new NPM project. Edit the name field.
{
“name”: “xxx”,
“version”: “0.1.0”,
“main”: “./build/electron/main.js”,
“scripts”: {
“dump”: “dump-stlite-desktop-artifacts”,
“serve”: “cross-env NODE_ENV=production electron .”,
“pack”: “electron-builder --dir”,
“dist”: “electron-builder”,
“postinstall”: “electron-builder install-app-deps”
},
“build”: {
“files”: [“build/**/*”],
“directories”: {
“buildResources”: “assets”
}
},
“devDependencies”: {
“@stlite/desktop”: “^0.25.0”,
“cross-env”: “^7.0.3”,
“electron”: “23.1.1”,
“electron-builder”: “^23.6.0”
}
}
Here you should change it to the following:
->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->->
},
“devDependencies”: {
“@stlite/desktop”: “^0.31.0”,
“cross-env”: “^7.0.3”, (check your version, by running npm show cross-env in the command)
“electron”: “23.1.1”, (check your version – for me it was 23.1.1)
“electron-builder”: “^24.4.0” (depending on the version)
}
}
2. Run npm update (instead of npm install).
3. Create streamlit_app directory.
o Any directory name can be used here.
4. Create streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py.
o Change the directory name if you used a different name in the previous step.
5. Write your Streamlit app code in streamlit_app/streamlit_app.py.
o The file name streamlit_app.py is not configurable now.
6. Optionally, you can add more contents in the directory, including pages/*.py for multi-page apps, any data files, and so on.
7. Run npm run dump streamlit_app – -r requirements.txt (the requirements file includes like the following:
streamlit
plotly
pandas
8. Run npm run serve (or similar to the video –servewindows)
9. Run npm run dist or yarn dist for packaging.
o This command bundles the ./build directory created in the step above into application files (.app, .exe, .dmg etc.) in the ./dist directory. To customize the built app, e.g. setting the icon, follow the electron-builder instructions.
